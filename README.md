Background Removal using rembg
Introduction
This Python script demonstrates how to use the rembg library to remove the background from an image. This can be useful for various applications, including image processing and graphic design.

Requirements
Before running the script, make sure you have the following requirements installed:

Python 3.x
rembg: The background removal library.
Pillow: A Python Imaging Library that we use to load and save images.
You can install these packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install rembg Pillow
Usage
Place the image you want to process in the same directory as the script or provide the path to your image in the input_path variable.

Open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.

Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python background_removal.py
The script will remove the background from the image and save the result in the same directory as output.png.
Configuration
You can configure the script by modifying the following variables in the script:

input_path: The path to the input image you want to process.
output_path: The path where the processed image will be saved.
Example
Here's an example of how to use the script:

bash
Copy code
python background_removal.py
This will process the image specified in input_path and save the result as output.png.
